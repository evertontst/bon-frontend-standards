# Balance of Nature - Front-end Coding Standards and Best Practices

## Overview

These principles, guidelines and standards allow us to:

- the code must be readable and understandable by all team members. 
- produce code of a consistent quality across all projects
- work simultaneously with multiple developers on the same codebase at the same time in the same way
- produce code less prone to bugs and regressions, easier to understand and debug
- write code that supports re-use.
- assistance in onboarding new development team members for new and existing projects.
